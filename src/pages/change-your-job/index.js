              . According to the Minnesota Office of Environmental Assistance,
              the average office worker uses 10,000 sheets of copy paper each
              year. The U.S. EPA estimates that paper and paperboard account for
              almost 40 percent of our garbage. Here are some other statistics
              to keep in mind when looking for ways to reduce paper use and
              costs.

              production of the business or even organic waste such as the
              employee's lunch scraps.

                Businesses often believe that is more cost effective to keep
